**SpotiFlux**

SpotiFlux is a python backend application that utilizes the Spotify web api to aggregate random snippets of music from 
playlists in a Spotify category chosen by the user in a python GUI. The application plays 30 seconds of each song and 
moves on to the next. Examples of categories involved are hip-hop, pop, chill, edm-dance, decades, toplists, and plenty 
more. To build the application, make sure you have Python3 and pip3 installed. Then, you can clone the repository and run
'make build' from the command line to install all the requirements, then 'make run' to actually run the application.
